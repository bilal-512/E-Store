## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues to Check

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env` file exists with proper configuration
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` properly set
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` properly configured
- [ ] Port configuration correct

### 2. Database Connection
- [ ] MongoDB service running
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] Collections properly created
- [ ] Indexes properly set

### 3. User Permissions
- [ ] Admin users have `manageUsers` permission
- [ ] User roles properly assigned
- [ ] Permission checks working correctly

### 4. Authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens properly generated
- [ ] Token validation working
- [ ] Token expiration handled
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism (if needed)

## üîß Testing Steps

### 1. Server Setup
```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod

# Start backend server
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Create super admin (if needed)
cd backend
npm run create-admin
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
# Start frontend
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. Test Scenarios
- [ ] User can create balance request
- [ ] User can view their request history
- [ ] Admin can view all balance requests
- [ ] Admin can approve/reject requests
- [ ] User balance updates when request approved
- [ ] Proper error messages displayed
- [ ] Loading states work correctly

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Server connection failed"
**Solution:** Ensure MongoDB and backend server are running

### Issue 2: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Check JWT token validity and user credentials

### Issue 3: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Ensure admin user has `manageUsers` permission

### Issue 4: "Balance request already pending"
**Solution:** Check if user already has a pending request

### Issue 5: "Invalid amount"
**Solution:** Ensure requested amount is positive number

## üìä Expected Behavior

### User Flow:
1. User logs in
2. User submits balance request with amount and reason
3. Request saved with 'pending' status
4. User can view their request history
5. Admin processes the request
6. User balance updates if approved

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin logs in
2. Admin views all balance requests
3. Admin can filter by status
4. Admin can approve/reject with notes
5. User balance automatically updates
6. Request status changes accordingly

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The balance request functionality appears to be **properly implemented** with:
- Complete backend API
- Proper frontend interface
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling
- Database integration

**No major errors found** in the code structure. The system should work correctly when properly configured and running.
